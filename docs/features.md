This Team Health Dashboard concept provides a comprehensive view of your team's performance across various dimensions. Here's a brief explanation of why these metrics are important and how they can be used:

- Sprint Velocity and Burndown help you understand your team's capacity and how well they're meeting sprint goals.
- Cycle Time and Code Review Time give insights into your team's efficiency and potential bottlenecks in the development process.
- Pull Request Size and Build Success Rate can indicate code quality and highlight areas where the team might need additional support or training.
- Bug Resolution Time and WIP Items help you manage the team's focus and responsiveness to issues.
- Sprint Goal Achievement Rate provides a high-level view of how well the team is meeting its commitments.
- Team Happiness Index, while more subjective, can give you early warning signs of potential issues affecting team morale.
