# Test Scenarios for GitHubService.ts

Test fetchData method:

- Test with default time period
- Test with custom time period
- Test with progress callback
- Test error handling

Test fetchAllPullRequests method:

- Test with single page of results
- Test with multiple pages of results
- Test with maximum page limit reached
- Test with empty result

Test fetchPageOfPullRequests method:

- Test successful fetch
- Test with progress callback

Test trackPageProgress method:

- Test internal progress tracker called
- Test external progress callback called

Test calculateMetrics method:

- Test with empty pull requests array
- Test with non-empty pull requests array

Test handleFetchError method:

- Test with Error instance
- Test with non-Error instance

Test Pagination

- Add tests to verify that the service correctly handles multiple pages of pull requests.
- Test the behavior when the maximum page limit is reached.

Edge Cases:

- Test with an empty array of pull requests.
- Test with a very large number of pull requests to ensure performance.

Time Period Handling:

- Add tests with edge case time periods (e.g., 0 days, negative days, very large number of days).

Metric Calculation:

- Add more detailed tests for metric calculation, possibly mocking different types of pull requests and verifying the resulting metrics.

Progress Tracking:

- Add more detailed tests for progress tracking, verifying that progress is reported correctly for multi-page fetches.

Configuration:

- Test how the service behaves with different configuration settings.

Snapshot Testing:

- Consider adding snapshot tests for complex return values to catch unintended changes in the data structure.

Typescript Type Checking:

- Ensure that the tests are also checking TypeScript types correctly, possibly by adding type assertions in the tests.
