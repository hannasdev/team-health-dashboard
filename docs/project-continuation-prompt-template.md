Example:
"I'm continuing work on the Team Health Dashboard project. 

Current Focus: Implementing the MetricsController.

Goal: Create a RESTful API endpoint that returns all metrics.

Context: 
- Last implemented: GitHubService and GoogleSheetsService
- Challenge: Deciding on the best way to structure the API response

Constraints:
- Time: 2-hour coding session
- Must use Express.js

Specific Questions:
1. How should we handle potential errors from the individual services?
2. What's the best way to format the API response for easy consumption by the frontend?

Preferred Approach: TDD, following RESTful best practices

Next Steps: After this, I plan to implement authentication for the API.

Can you guide me through implementing the MetricsController with these considerations in mind?"
